"""Subdivision feasibility + profit (client v4 spec, confirmed June 2026).

Feasibility:
  - Zones that allow only 1 dwelling per lot (Single House, Large Lot, Rural)
    are NEVER subdividable, regardless of land size
    (client: "single house zone is exactly that one house cannot be subdivided at all").
  - Multi-dwelling zones (Mixed Housing, Terrace & Apartment) are land-driven:
      usable land  = land × (1 − road allowance)        [allowance 10%]
      sections     = FLOOR(usable land ÷ zone min lot)
      feasible     = sections ≥ 2
      subdividable = feasible AND profit > 0   (a site that loses money is not
                     an opportunity; the figures are still returned so the
                     detail page can show why the answer is no)
      dwellings    = sections × max dwellings per lot

Profit (§6):
      section value  = section $/m² rate × zone min lot
      gross sales    = sections × section value
      subdivision cost = (new sections) × $80,000   [new = sections − 1; dev contribution + services]
      selling cost   = gross sales × 4%   [real-estate cost per site]
      acquisition cost = buy price × 2%
      profit = gross sales − buy price − subdivision cost − selling cost − acquisition cost

Section $/m² rate is derived automatically from the sold data (see SectionRates),
never a manual table — bare section sales first, council land values second,
$850/m² as a fallback when the suburb has neither.
