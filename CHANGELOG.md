# Apex Property — build log

Every build bumps the version by 0.1 in **both** repositories, and the admin
dashboard shows the two side by side.

The number exists so a bug report can be checked against a build. "That was
fixed" and "it is still broken" are both easy to say and, until now, impossible
to reconcile: the two halves deploy separately, and a backend can sit days
behind its frontend with nothing on screen saying so. Every symptom then reads
as a new bug rather than an old one that was fixed but never deployed.

Check the running build at **Admin → Business & data dashboard**, or hit
`/api/version` directly — that one needs no login, because the times you most
need it include the times nobody can sign in.

## v1.1 — 2026-08-15

**Sign-in**
- Accounts whose stored email had capitals or a stray space could never sign in.
  The lookup lowercased the input and compared it to the column as written, so
  no input could match; the account answered 401 with the correct password.
  Lookups are now case- and space-insensitive, and a boot repair normalises
  existing rows (the boot log reports how many were unreachable).
- Sign-up and admin-create now detect an existing address case-insensitively,
  so the same person cannot end up with two accounts.
- A refused sign-in now logs **why** — no such account, wrong password, or a
  stored value that is not a hash at all. The response is still a bare 401, so
  the reason is not exposed to the browser.
- Account creation is logged, so "I signed up and cannot log in" splits into
  "the account was never created" and "it exists but the password fails".

**Admin**
- Users can be edited (email, name, company, phone, role), have their password
  set, and be deleted. Guards: you cannot delete the account you are signed in
  as, and you cannot delete, demote or deactivate the last active admin.
- Ask Ollie now runs on one account-wide API key set by an admin, capped at 20
  answers per user per day (configurable; 0 switches it off without deleting the
  key). A user with their own key uses that and is not capped. Usage per user is
  visible in the admin panel.
- Build versions panel on the dashboard.

**Numbers we were getting wrong**
- "What moves value here" reported **+$1.04M for a bedroom** in Remuera against a
  $1.70M median, and a bathroom worth more than a bedroom. The estimator compared
  two three-sale medians and never controlled for land, so the bedroom was
  standing in for a few hundred square metres of section. Replaced with a
  regression across every sale in the suburb, holding floor area and land area
  constant, published with a 95% interval and withheld when the sales cannot
  separate the room from the house.
- Listings advertised by negotiation or auction carried a hidden search price
  that we were publishing as an asking price, a valuation and a margin. Those
  listings keep their valuation and lose the invented price.
- `_median` returned the upper of the two middle values on an even count,
  biasing every even-count median in the suburb panel upward.
- Subdividable sites were ranked by lot count, putting a four-lot site in a cheap
  suburb above a one-lot site worth six times as much. Now ranked by net gain.

**Screens**
- Suburb pickers are dropdowns everywhere, built from the batch with sold and
  live counts — a free-text box could not tell a typo from a suburb that is
  genuinely not in the data.
- The dashboard shows the top 3 underpriced (by dollar gap) and top 3
  subdividable (by net gain), not just totals and a link.
- The monthly suburb series can be split by bedroom count.
- The assistant is called **Ask Ollie**.
- Geo endpoints degrade instead of 500ing when their tables are missing.
