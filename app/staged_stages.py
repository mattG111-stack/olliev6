"""Operator-triggered stages for the staged weekly release.

The four-stage flow — LOAD → ENRICH → PRICE → PUBLISH — with each stage
independently re-runnable and its progress persisted to the database so it
survives a page refresh or a browser disconnect:

    1. LOAD     upload stages raw rows and prices them on what's present. Fast,
                no external calls. (app.ingest.ingest_for_sale, fill_missing=False)
    2. ENRICH   this module: fill blank floor / land / CV from CoreLogic, on the
                stored rows, re-runnable — a re-run only fills what is STILL blank,
                so a stage that died at 60% resumes instead of restarting.
    3. PRICE    this module: re-run the pricing pipeline over the staged batch
                (app.reprice.reprice_batch), so a fix to the pricing code re-values
                the batch without a re-upload.
    4. PUBLISH  app.release.publish_release promotes the staged batch to live.

Each ENRICH / PRICE run is tracked by an IngestJob row: rows_total / rows_inserted
(processed) / rows_filled / rows_missed and a terminal status, all committed as the
stage runs. The long-running work happens on a background thread that owns its own
DB session, so the request returns immediately and /health keeps answering while
the stage runs (the container is no longer killed for a blocked request process).

    The old anchor guard set a CV-anchored valuation UP to ~95% of the external

    at $1.22M, a land-only-CV new build at $3.9M. The signature is precise:
    fair_value ≈ 0.95 × the AVM AND far above the CV.

    The current code NEVER produces fair_value = 0.95 × AVM when a CV is present
