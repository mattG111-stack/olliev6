"""One-shot DB bootstrap, run before uvicorn on every boot.

Heals a database left inconsistent by an earlier repo upload (production was
stamped at revision `a9f4c2e81b30`, which this codebase no longer contains, and
that migration also created columns as NOT NULL that these models treat as
optional). Symptoms it fixes:

  * `alembic upgrade head` aborting with "Can't locate revision" → app never
    started (took logins + all data down).
  * every ingest-job insert failing with NotNullViolation (upload/enrich/publish
    500s) because a column the models leave null is NOT NULL in the DB.

What it does, without invoking alembic:
  1. Ensure the columns this codebase added exist (idempotent ADD COLUMN).
  2. Reconcile NULLability to the models everywhere: for every column the models
     declare nullable, DROP NOT NULL in the DB if it's currently NOT NULL. This
     covers ANY column that old migration over-constrained, not just a guessed
     few.
  3. Reset `alembic_version` to this codebase's head, ignoring the unknown rev.

Each statement runs in its own transaction so one failure can't poison the rest,
and nothing here ever aborts startup — a running app beats a dead one.
